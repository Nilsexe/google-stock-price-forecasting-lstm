## 📋 Overview
This project focuses on using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for time-series forecasting. It is fully documented and covers several key processes:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleanup and prepare data for analysis.
2. **Sequence Generation:** Create sequences from historical stock prices.
3. **Model Training:** Teach the LSTM model to recognize patterns.
4. **Performance Evaluation:** Analyze the model’s accuracy using RMSE (Root Mean Square Error).
5. **Visualization:** Display the results in an easy-to-understand format.

## ⚙️ System Requirements
Ensure you meet the following system requirements:

- Operating System: Windows 10 or later, macOS, or Linux
- Python version: 3.6 or later
- At least 4 GB of RAM
- An internet connection to download data
