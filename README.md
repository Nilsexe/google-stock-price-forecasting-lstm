## 🧠 Overview

This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** deep learning model to forecast the closing price of **Google (GOOGL)** stock.

The notebook walks through a full, production-style time-series pipeline — including data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

The purpose of the project is to explore the effectiveness of recurrent neural networks in financial time-series analysis and trend forecasting.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Load and visualize historical Google stock market data  
- Prepare time-series sequences suitable for LSTM networks  
- Build and train an LSTM model using TensorFlow/Keras  
- Evaluate predictions using **RMSE**
- Plot actual vs. predicted values  
- Discuss limitations and future improvements
